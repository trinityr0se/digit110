                    <p><date when="1888-07-10">Tuesday, July 10</date>, according to instructions
                from <name ref="CT">THE TIMES</name>, I made up for the role of shop-girl, &amp;
                with a list of factories in one hand and gentle peace in the other sailed down
                    <placeName type="locRef">State street</placeName> under a brown braise veil as
                impenetrable as an iron mask. The fifth place on <w type="poss">my</w>
                <w type="noun">list</w> was the <orgName ref="WLMC">Western Lace Manufacturing
                    Co.</orgName>
                <placeName type="address">218 State street</placeName>. Ascending one flight of
                stairs I stopped to take off <w type="poss">my</w>
                <w type="noun">veil</w> and adjust <w type="poss">my</w>
                <w type="noun">eyes</w> to the low light. That done I looked about and finding a door
                marked Office of the <orgName ref="WLMC">Western Lace Manufacturing Co.</orgName>
                with <hi rend="double">Come In</hi> on the glass I complied. A young girl followed
                and leaving her to close the door I fell into a chair, the only one about, and
                proceeded to perspire and scrutinize the place.</p>
